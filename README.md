# Code Ratatouille
 
**Disclaimer:** The code is *only* proven to work; please do not, however, use this as a to-go source for learning programming languages' cool stuff.

Some of the notes may be incorrect; if there happens to be an issue, please file it under the "Issues" tab on GitHub.

The cases here should rarely happen with day-to-day coding. Hope it helps you as much as it did to me in learning about it. However, similar cases are there in courses [CS 61A](http://cs61a.org) & [CS 61B](http://datastructur.es) at UC Berkeley.
